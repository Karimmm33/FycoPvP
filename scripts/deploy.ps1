.SYNOPSIS
    Copy the addon from this project into a live WoW client for testing.

.DESCRIPTION
    This project is the source of truth. The copy inside the WoW client is
    disposable: deploy overwrites it, so never edit the client copy and expect
    the change to survive.

    Only the files the addon actually needs are sent. Everything that makes
    this a development project -- .git, docs, scripts, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md --
    stays behind, so the client folder looks exactly like what a user unzips.

    Modules, Textures and Voice are MIRRORED, so a file deleted here is deleted
    there too. That is what stops a module you removed from lingering in the
    client and loading from a stale .toc entry.

.PARAMETER ClientPath
    The addon folder inside the client. Defaults to the Frostmourne install.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\deploy.ps1
    .\scripts\deploy.ps1 -WhatIf
    .\scripts\deploy.ps1 -ClientPath "C:\Games\WoW\Interface\AddOns\FycoPvP"
